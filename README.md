# Bernoulli Distribution - Scoring penalty Kick
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to model and simulate a Bernoulli distribution, using the example of a team Score penalty Kick. The Bernoulli distribution is a simple probability distribution that models binary outcomesâ€”success or failure, pass or fail.

## Key Concepts:
* **Bernoulli Distribution:** A probability distribution for a random variable that has only two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).
* **Success:** In this project, a success is defined as a player Score penalty Kick.
* **Failure:** A failure is defined as a player not scoring a penalty kick.
* **Probability (p):** The chance of success. In this project, we assume an 60% probability that a player Score penalty Kick.
* **Probability (q):** The chances of failure. The chances of failure are calculated as *1 - p*.
