# Bernoulli Distribution - Scoring A Penalty Kick
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to model and simulate a Bernoulli distribution, using the example of a team soccer player's penalty kicks. The Bernoulli distribution is a simple probability distribution that models binary outcomesâ€”success(goal) or failure(miss).

## Key Concepts:
* **Bernoulli Distribution:** A probability distribution modelling two possible outcomes: success/goal (1) or failure/miss (0).
* **Success(1):** In this project, success is a player scoring a penalty kick.
* **Failure(0):** A failure is a player missing a penalty kick.
* **Probability of Success(p):** We assume a 60% chance of scoring, so *p = 0.60*
* **Probability of Failure (q):** The chance of missing is *q = 1 - p = 0.40*.
